Background
Traveling expenses can add up quickly. Especially if you're food focused like me. This tool is meant to highlight various costs (in USD) for food all around the world! 

Simply think of a destination you're curious about, choose one of five categories to view, hover over that area to quickly and easily see what the average cost of keeping your tummy happy would look like! 

Checkout what the cost of a three-course meal for 2 people in an average restaurant looks like in Taipei, Taiwan, or inexpensive meal for 1 in Teran, Iran, or a cappuccino in Tel-Aviv, Israel, a dozen eggs in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, or even a kilo of tomatoes in Kingston,Jamaica! 

Happy Exploring!

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
-RMaps, Leaflet, svgMAP, or  D3 to render the map with locations and API data from Traveltables for all the prices

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: researching about how to use API and D3 and hopefully start to make the basic outline of the pages structure.

Monday: integrating the data and map together, parsing the data and writing code

Tuesday: integrating the data and map together, parsing the data and writing code

Wednesday: spend time styling with CSS  

Thursday Morning: Freaking out while deploying to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

Bonus features
Some addition features to look forawrd to are:

- information and pictures of national and local dishes to try in the country and regions
